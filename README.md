# What makes up a London house price?
As someone who is looking to buy their next home in London, I was compelled to use my Python skills to analyse the relationship between multiple variables and the price of a property. 
Through Kaggle I was able to find a data set of 2023 house prices in a number of London Boroughs. This dataset contained multiple variables that could be used to determine the value of a house including; the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, proximity to a local station, and the type of ownership available. 
There were both categorical and numerical variables available to analyse. 
The numerical variables were:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Miles to the nearest train station
- Price in pounds (This is the variable we are trying to predict)
The categorical variables were:
- Has a garden
- Propert Tenure (meaning the type of legal ownership available with 3 different options)
- The postcode
- The street
- The name of the nearest train station
